# Explored Use Cases
 
## 1. Seamless UX

People don’t need to even take out their phone and can just pass their finger to do a TX.

## 2. User with no access to internet/phone at any given point

There are many instances where people don’t have access to internet/phone and are stuck in places, in such instances, a simple fingerprint would enable them to pay upto 100$ at any Merchant PoS.

## 3. A complete PoS machine

A complete PoS machine containing both fingerprint / qr code option and has display built in to be operated as a independent machine.

## 4. People with no access to traditional banking (Research in progress)
Many people don’t have access to convential banking system, due to document issue or more. These people can just show up at a booth and get themself a wallet, if they don’t have a phone at that point, a non-custodial wallet will be open linked to their fingerprint, and they can then use at any merchant PoS.

# Vision

The vision is to have a decentralized network of PoS where anyone can have access to financial infrastructure without being dependent on any provider like bank/government for opening a bank account or shit.
